                strong points. We have seen how easy it is to display test results and to
                publish Javadocs, but you can also publish a large number of other very
                useful reports using Jenkins&#8217;s plugins.
         </p>
         <p>Plugins<a class="indexterm" name="ch02-plugin"></a><a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e2312"></a><a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e2317"></a> are another one of Jenkins&#8217;s selling points&#8212;there are
                plugins for doing just about anything, from integrating new build tools or
                version control systems to <span class="keep-together">notification</span> mechanisms and reporting. In
                addition, Jenkins plugins are very easy to install and integrate smoothly
                into the existing Jenkins architecture.
         </p>
         <p>To see how the plugins work, we are going to integrate code coverage
                metrics using the Cobertura plugin. Code coverage is an indication of how
                much of your application code is actually executed during your tests&#8212;it
                can be a useful tool in particular for finding areas of code that have not
                been tested by your test suites. It can also give some indication as to
                how well a team is applying good testing practices such as Test-Driven
                Development or Behavior-Driven Development.
         </p>
         <p><a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://cobertura.sourceforge.net" target="_top">Cobertura</a> is
                an open source code coverage tool that works well with both Maven and
                Jenkins. Our Maven demonstration project is already configured to record
                code coverage metrics, so all we need to do is to install the Jenkins
                Cobertura plugin and generate the code coverage metrics for Jenkins to
                record and display.

            </div>
            <p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.27.&nbsp;Jenkins has a large range of plugins available</b></p>
         </div><br class="figure-break"><p>To install a new plugin, go to the Manage Jenkins page and click on
                the Manage Plugins entry. This will display a list of the available
                plugins as well as the plugins already installed on your server (see <a href="sect-first-steps-metrics.html#fig-hudson-plugin-manager" title="Figure&nbsp;2.27.&nbsp;Jenkins has a large range of plugins available">Figure&nbsp;2.27, &#8220;Jenkins has a large range of plugins available&#8221;</a>). If your build server doesn&#8217;t have
                an Internet connection, you can also manually install a plugin by
                downloading the plugin file elsewhere and uploading it to your Jenkins
                installation (just open the Advanced tab in <a href="sect-first-steps-metrics.html#fig-hudson-plugin-manager" title="Figure&nbsp;2.27.&nbsp;Jenkins has a large range of plugins available">Figure&nbsp;2.27, &#8220;Jenkins has a large range of plugins available&#8221;</a>), or by copying the plugin to the
                <code class="filename">$JENKINS_HOME/plugins</code>
                directory.
         </p>
         <p>In our case, we are interested in the Cobertura plugin, so go to the
                Available tab and scroll down until you find the Cobertura Plugin entry in
                the Build Reports section. Click on the checkbox and then click on the
                Install button at the bottom of the screen.
         </p>
         <p>This will download and install the plugin for you. Once it is done,
                you will need to restart your Jenkins instance to see the fruits of your
                labor. When you have restarted Jenkins, go back to the Manage Plugins
                screen and click on the Installed tab&#8212;there should now be a Cobertura
                Plugin entry in the list of installed plugins on this<a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e2355"></a> page.
         </p>
         <p>Once you have made sure the plugin was successfully installed, go to
                the configuration page for the <span><strong class="command">gameoflife-default</strong></span> build
                job.
         </p>
         <p>To <a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e2365"></a>set up code coverage metrics in our project, we need to do
                two things. First we need to generate the Cobertura coverage data in an
                XML form that Jenkins can use; then we need to configure Jenkins to
                display the coverage reports.
         </p>
         <p>Our Game of Life project already has been configured to generate XML
                code coverage reports if we ask it. All you need to do is to run
                <code class="literal">mvn cobertura:cobertura</code> to generate the reports in XML
                form. Cobertura can also generate HTML reports, but in our case we will be
                letting Jenkins take care of the reporting, so we can save on build time
                by not generating the For this example, for simplicity, we will just add
                the <code class="literal">cobertura:cobertura</code> goal to the second build step
                (see <a href="sect-first-steps-metrics.html#fig-hudson-cobertura-build-step" title="Figure&nbsp;2.28.&nbsp;Adding another Maven goal to generating test coverage metrics">Figure&nbsp;2.28, &#8220;Adding another Maven goal to generating test coverage
                     metrics&#8221;</a>). You could also
                add a new build step just for the code coverage metrics. In a real-world
                project, code quality metrics like this are typically placed in a distinct
                build job, which is run less frequently than the default build.

                        metrics</b></p>
         </div><br class="figure-break"><p>Next, we need to tell Jenkins to keep track of our code coverage
                metrics. Scroll down to the &#8220;Post-build Actions&#8221; section. You should see a
                new checkbox labeled Publish Cobertura Reports. Jenkins will often add UI
                elements like this when you install a new plugin. When you tick this box,
                Jenkins will display the configuration options for the Cobertura plugin
                that we installed earlier (see <a href="sect-first-steps-metrics.html#fig-hudson-cobertura-config" title="Figure&nbsp;2.29.&nbsp;Configuring the test coverage metrics in Jenkins">Figure&nbsp;2.29, &#8220;Configuring the test coverage metrics in Jenkins&#8221;</a>).
         </p>
         <p>Like most of the code-quality related plugins in Jenkins, the
                Cobertura plugin lets you fine-tune not only the way Jenkins displays the
                report data, but also how it interprets the data. In the Coverage Metrics
                Targets section, you can define what you consider to be the minimum
                acceptable levels of code coverage. In <a href="sect-first-steps-metrics.html#fig-hudson-cobertura-config" title="Figure&nbsp;2.29.&nbsp;Configuring the test coverage metrics in Jenkins">Figure&nbsp;2.29, &#8220;Configuring the test coverage metrics in Jenkins&#8221;</a>, we have configured<a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e2398"></a><a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e2403"></a> Jenkins to list any builds with less than 50% test coverage
                as &#8220;unstable&#8221; (indicated by a yellow ball), and notify the team
                accordingly.
         </p>

            <p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.29.&nbsp;Configuring the test coverage metrics in Jenkins</b></p>
         </div><br class="figure-break"><p>This fine-tuning often comes in handy in real-world builds. For
                example, you may want to impose a special code coverage constraint in
                release builds, to ensure high code coverage in release versions. Another
                strategy that can be useful for legacy projects is to gradually increase
                the minimum tolerated code coverage level over time. This way you can
                avoid having to retro-fit unit tests on legacy code just to raise the code
                coverage, but you do encourage all new code and bug fixes to be well
                tested.
         </p>
         <p>Now trigger a build manually. The first time you run the build job
                with Cobertura reporting activated, you will see coverage statistics for
                your build displayed on the build home page, along with a Coverage Report
                link when you can go for more details (see <a href="sect-first-steps-metrics.html#fig-hudson-initial-coverage-report" title="Figure&nbsp;2.30.&nbsp;Jenkins displays code coverage metrics on the build home page">Figure&nbsp;2.30, &#8220;Jenkins displays code coverage metrics on the build home
                     page&#8221;</a>). The Cobertura report
                shows different types of code coverage for the build we just ran. Since we
                have only run the test coverage metrics once, the coverage will be
                displayed as red and green bars.
         </p>
         <div class="figure-float">
            <div class="figure"><a name="fig-hudson-initial-coverage-report"></a><div class="figure-contents">

                           page</b></p>
            </div><br class="figure-break"></div>
         <p>If you click on the Coverage Report icon, you will see code coverage
                for each package in your application, and even drill down to see the code
                coverage (or lack thereof) for an individual class (see <a href="sect-first-steps-metrics.html#fig-hudson-code-coverage-class" title="Figure&nbsp;2.31.&nbsp;Jenkins lets you display code coverage metrics for packages and classes">Figure&nbsp;2.31, &#8220;Jenkins lets you display code coverage metrics for packages and
                     classes&#8221;</a>). When you get to this level,
                Jenkins displays both the overall coverage statistics for the class, and
                also highlights the lines that were executed in green, and those that
                weren&#8217;t in red.
         </p>
         <p>This reporting gets better with time. Jenkins not only reports
                metrics data for the latest build, but also keeps track of metrics over
                time, so that you can see how they evolve throughout the life of the
                project.
         </p>
         <p>For example, if you drill down into the coverage reports, you will
                notice that certain parts of this code are not<a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e2441"></a> tested (for example the <code class="literal">Cell.java</code> class
                in <a href="sect-first-steps-metrics.html#fig-hudson-code-coverage-class" title="Figure&nbsp;2.31.&nbsp;Jenkins lets you display code coverage metrics for packages and classes">Figure&nbsp;2.31, &#8220;Jenkins lets you display code coverage metrics for packages and

                been tested, in order to add extra tests for corner cases that were not
                properly tested during the initial development, for example. The Jenkins
                code coverage graphs are also a great way of keeping track of your code
                coverage metrics as the project grows. Indeed, as you add new tests, you
                will notice that Jenkins will display a graph of code coverage over time,
                not just the latest results (see <a href="sect-first-steps-metrics.html#fig-hudson-code-coverage-graph" title="Figure&nbsp;2.32.&nbsp;Jenkins also displays a graph of code coverage over time">Figure&nbsp;2.32, &#8220;Jenkins also displays a graph of code coverage over time&#8221;</a>).

                just for the sake of improving code coverage&#8212;we are adding an extra test
                to verify some code that was not previously tested, and as a result the
                code coverage goes up. There is a subtle but important difference
                here&#8212;code coverage, as with any other metric, is very much a means to an
                end (high code quality and low maintenance costs), and not an end in
                itself.
