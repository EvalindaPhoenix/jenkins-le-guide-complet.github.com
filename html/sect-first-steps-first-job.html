         <p>Build jobs<a class="indexterm" name="ch02-jobcreate"></a> are at the heart of the Jenkins build process. Simply put,
            you can think of a Jenkins build job as a particular task or step in your
            build process. This may involve simply compiling your source code and
            running your unit tests. Or you might want a build job to do other related
            tasks, such as running your integration tests, measuring code coverage or
                code quality metrics, generating technical documentation, or even
                deploying your application to a web server. A real project usually
                requires many separate but related build jobs.
         </p>
         <p>Our sample application is a simple Java implementation of John
                Conway&#8217;s <a class="indexterm" name="ch02-game"></a>&#8220;Game of Life.&#8221;<sup>[<a name="footnote-game-of-life" href="#ftn.footnote-game-of-life">2</a>]</sup> The Game of Life is a mathematical game which takes place on
                a two dimensional grid of cells, which we will refer to as the Universe.
                Each cell can be either alive or dead. Cells interact with their direct
                neighbors to determine whether they will live or die in the next
                generation of cells. For each new generation of cells, the following rules
                are applied:
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
               <li>
                  <p>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies of
                             underpopulation.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies of
                             overcrowding.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the
                             next generation.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live
                             cell.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>Our application is a Java module, built using Maven, that implements
                the core business logic of the Game of Life. We&#8217;ll worry about the user
                interfaces later on. For now, let&#8217;s see how we can automate this build in
                Jenkins. If you are not familiar with Maven, or prefer Ant or another
                build framework&#8212;don&#8217;t worry! The examples don&#8217;t require much knowledge of
                Maven, and we&#8217;ll be looking at plenty of examples of using other build
                tools later on in the book.
         </p>
         <p>For our first build job, we will keep it simple: we are just going
                to compile and test our sample application. Click on the New Job link. You
                should get to a screen similar to <a href="sect-first-steps-first-job.html#fig-first-build-job" title="Figure&nbsp;2.14.&nbsp;Setting up your first build job in Jenkins">Figure&nbsp;2.14, &#8220;Setting up your first build job in Jenkins&#8221;</a>.
                Jenkins supports several different types of <a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1633"></a>build jobs. The two most commonly-used are the freestyle
                builds and the Maven 2/3 builds. The <a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1639"></a>freestyle projects allow you to configure just about any
                sort of build job: they are highly flexible and very configurable. The
                <a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1643"></a>Maven 2/3 builds understand the Maven project structure, and
                can use this to let you set up Maven build jobs with less effort and a few
                extra features. There are also plugins that provide support for other
                types of build jobs. Nevertheless, although our project does use Maven, we
                are going to use a<a class="indexterm" name="ch02-freecreate"></a> freestyle build job, just to keep things simple and general
                to start with. So choose &#8220;Build a freestyle software project&#8221;, as shown in
                <a href="sect-first-steps-first-job.html#fig-first-build-job" title="Figure&nbsp;2.14.&nbsp;Setting up your first build job in Jenkins">Figure&nbsp;2.14, &#8220;Setting up your first build job in Jenkins&#8221;</a>.
         </p>
         <p>You&#8217;ll <a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1658"></a>also need to give your build job a sensible name. In this
                case, call it <span class="emphasis"><em>gameoflife-default</em></span>, as it will be the
                default CI build for our Game of Life project.
         </p>

            <p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.14.&nbsp;Setting up your first build job in Jenkins</b></p>
         </div><br class="figure-break"><p>Once you click on OK, Jenkins will display the project configuration
                screen (see <span class="keep-together"><a href="sect-first-steps-first-job.html#fig-jenkins-git-new-project" title="Figure&nbsp;2.15.&nbsp;Telling Jenkins where to find the source code">Figure&nbsp;2.15, &#8220;Telling Jenkins where to find the source code&#8221;</a></span>).
         </p>
         <p>In a nutshell, Jenkins works by checking out the source code of your
                project and building it in its own workspace. So the next thing you need
                to do is to tell Jenkins where it can find the <a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1682"></a>source code for your project. You do this in the<a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1688"></a> Source Code Management <a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1694"></a><a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1699"></a>section (see <a href="sect-first-steps-first-job.html#fig-jenkins-git-new-project" title="Figure&nbsp;2.15.&nbsp;Telling Jenkins where to find the source code">Figure&nbsp;2.15, &#8220;Telling Jenkins where to find the source code&#8221;</a>). Jenkins<a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1707"></a> provides support for CVS and Subversion out of the box, and
                many others such as Git, Mercurial, ClearCase, Perforce and many more via
                plugins.
         </p>
         <p>For this project, we will be getting the source code from the GitHub
                repository we set up earlier. On the Jenkins screen, choose &#8220;Git&#8221; and
                enter the Repository URL we defined in <a href="sect-first-steps-environment.html#sect-git-fork" title="2.2.5.&nbsp;Forker le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t des exemples">Section&nbsp;2.2.5, &#8220;Forker le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t des exemples&#8221;</a>

                the URL of your fork, and not of the original repository: it should have
                the form
                <span class="emphasis"><em>git@github.com:<em class="replaceable"><code>&lt;username&gt;</code></em>/game-of-life.git</em></span>,
                where <em class="replaceable"><code>&lt;username&gt;</code></em> is the username for your
                own GitHub account. You can leave all of the other options up until here
                with their default values.

                application, we need to tell it how often it should check for updates. We
                want Jenkins to monitor the <span class="keep-together">repository</span> and start a build whenever any
                changes have been committed. This is a common way to set up a build job in
                a Continuous Integration context, as it provides fast feedback if the
                build fails. Other approaches include building on regular intervals (for
                example, once a day), requiring a user to kick of the build manually, or
                even triggering a build remotely using a &#8220;post-commit&#8221; hook in your
                SCM.
         </p>
         <p>We configure all of this in the Build Triggers section (see <a href="sect-first-steps-first-job.html#fig-new-job-triggers" title="Figure&nbsp;2.16.&nbsp;Scheduling the build jobs">Figure&nbsp;2.16, &#8220;Scheduling the build jobs&#8221;</a>). Pick the Poll SCM option and enter &#8220;*
                * * * *&#8221; (that&#8217;s five asterisks separated by spaces) in the Schedule box.
                Jenkins schedules are configured using the <code class="literal">cron</code> syntax,
                well-known in the Unix world. The <code class="literal">cron</code> syntax consists
                of five fields separated by white space, indicating respectively <span class="keep-together">the</span> minute (0&#8211;59), hour (0&#8211;23), day of the
                month (1&#8211;31), month (1&#8211;12) and the day of the week (0&#8211;7, with 0 and 7
                being Sunday). The star is a wildcard character which accepts any valid
                value for that field. So five stars basically means &#8220;every minute of every
                hour of every day.&#8221; You can also provide ranges of values: &#8220;* 9-17 * * *&#8221;
                would mean &#8220;every minute of every day, between 9am and 5pm.&#8221; You can also
                space out the schedule using intervals: &#8220;*/5 * * * *&#8221; means &#8220;every 5
                minutes,&#8221; for example. Finally, there are some other convenient
                short-hands, such as &#8220;@daily&#8221; and &#8220;@hourly&#8221;.
         </p>
         <p>Don&#8217;t worry if your Unix skills are a little rusty&#8212;if you click on
                the blue question mark icon on the side of the schedule box, Jenkins will
                bring up a very complete <a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1770"></a>refresher.

                freestyle build job, you can break down your build job into a number of
                build steps. This makes it easier to organize builds in clean, separate
                stages. For example, a build might run a suite of functional tests in one
                step, and then tag the build in a second step if all of the functional
                tests succeed. In technical terms, a build step might involve invoking an
                Ant task or a Maven target, or running a shell script. There are also
                Jenkins plugins that let you use additional types of build steps: Gant,
                Grails, Gradle, Rake, Ruby, MSBuild and many other build tools are all
                supported.

         <p><a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1790"></a><a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1795"></a>For now, we just want to run a simple Maven build. Scroll
                down to the Build section and click on the &#8220;Add build step&#8221; and choose
                &#8220;Invoke top-level Maven targets&#8221; (see <a href="sect-first-steps-first-job.html#fig-new-job-build-step" title="Figure&nbsp;2.17.&nbsp;Adding a build step">Figure&nbsp;2.17, &#8220;Adding a build step&#8221;</a>). Then enter &#8220;clean package&#8221; in the
                Goals field. If you are not familiar with Maven, this will delete any
                previous build artifacts, compile our code, run our unit tests, and
                generate a JAR file.

         <p>By default, this build job will fail if the code does not compile or
                if any of the unit tests fail. That&#8217;s the most fundamental thing that
                you&#8217;d expect of any build server. But <span class="keep-together">Jenkins</span> also does a great job of helping you
                display your test results and test result trends.
         </p>
         <p>The<a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1820"></a><a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1827"></a><a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1834"></a> de facto standard for test reporting in the Java world is
                an <a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1842"></a>XML format used by JUnit.<a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1848"></a> This format is also used by many other Java testing tools,
                such as TestNG, Spock and Easyb. Jenkins understands this format, so if
                your build produces JUnit XML test results, Jenkins can generate nice
                graphical test reports and statistics on test results over time, and also
                let you view the details of any test failures. Jenkins also keeps track of
                how long your tests take to run, both globally, and per test&#8212;this can come
                in handy if you need to track down performance issues.
         </p>
         <p>So the next thing we need to do is to get Jenkins to keep tabs on
                our unit tests.
         </p>
         <p><a class="indexterm" name="I_indexterm2_d1e1858"></a>Go to the Post-build Actions section (see <a href="sect-first-steps-first-job.html#fig-new-job-test-reports" title="Figure&nbsp;2.18.&nbsp;Configuring JUnit test reports and artifact archiving">Figure&nbsp;2.18, &#8220;Configuring JUnit test reports and artifact archiving&#8221;</a>) and tick &#8220;Publish JUnit test result
                report&#8221; checkbox. When Maven runs unit tests in a project, it
                automatically generates the XML test reports in a directory called
                <code class="filename">surefire-reports</code> in the <code class="filename">target</code> directory. So enter
                &#8220;**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml&#8221; in the &#8220;Test report XMLs&#8221; field. The
                two asterisks at the start of the path (&#8220;**&#8221;) are a best practice to make
                the configuration a bit more robust: they allow Jenkins to find the target
                directory no matter how we have configured Jenkins to check out the source
                code.

                results. Jenkins can store a copy of the binary artifacts generated by
                your build, allowing you to download the binaries produced by a build
                directly from the build results page. It will also post the latest binary
                artifacts on the project home page, which is a convenient way to
                distribute the latest and greatest version of your application. You can
                activate this option by ticking the &#8220;Archive the artifacts&#8221; checkbox and
                indicating which binary artifacts you want Jenkins to archive. In <a href="sect-first-steps-first-job.html#fig-new-job-test-reports" title="Figure&nbsp;2.18.&nbsp;Configuring JUnit test reports and artifact archiving">Figure&nbsp;2.18, &#8220;Configuring JUnit test reports and artifact archiving&#8221;</a>, for example, we have configured
